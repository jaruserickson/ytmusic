'ytmusic' is a web application that compliments the sublime music listening experience YouTube offers.

Type the channel ID you'd like to listen to into the main frame, and enjoy!

## Usage
Just clone the repository wherever you feel, and open `index.html`!

Type in the youtube channel ID for the user you'd like to listen to. 

For example, if I want to listen to [Majestic Casual](https://youtube.com/majesticcasual), I would type in `majesticcasual` or `UCXIyz409s7bNWVcM-vjfdVA` since their channel can be accessed via [/UCXIyz...](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXIyz409s7bNWVcM-vjfdVA) or [/majesticcasual](https://youtube.com/majesticcasual).

Unfortunately I can't run this page online due to the nature of gh-pages. :pensive:
